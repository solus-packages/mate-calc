description: |
    This is `mate-calc`, a fork of `gnome-calc`, the calculator application
    that was previously in the OpenWindows Deskset of the Solaris 8
    operating system.

    It incorporates a multiple precision arithmetic packages based on the
    work of Professor Richard Brent, who has also kindly given me
    permission to make it available.
